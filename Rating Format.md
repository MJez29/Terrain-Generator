| Score | Explanation/Why |
| :---: | --- |
| <0 | Being greedy when asking for a score. Ex.1 Asking for a score of >= 1 when updating comments. Ex.2 Asking for a score of >= 1 on a very long overdue feature (such as asking for credit when it took you a week to add a rigidbody2d to a gameobject) |
| 0 | Adding comments or very simple things that anyone could do in a few minutes |
| 1 | Taking a lot of time to add a very basic feature such as taking a few days to implement trees in the game (as was proven at Ricky's it was possible to add them in under an hour |
| 2 | Adding a very basic feature in a reasonable amount of time such as adding trees in a few hours (or less) |
| 3 | Adding a moderate feature that is long overdue such as adding the night and day system in a few days (took me a few hours) |
